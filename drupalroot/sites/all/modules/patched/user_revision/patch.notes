Issue: Conflict with email_registration and user_revision results in github issue #40
which is that the username gets garbled instead of remaining as everything before the
"@" in the user's email address.

Patch: https://drupal.org/files/issues/2016671-conflict-email-registration-1.patch

Issue: user_revision module does not yet include sanitization through drush sqlsan
  and entity_load() still loads users original emails, so outgoing mail still goes
to original users.
